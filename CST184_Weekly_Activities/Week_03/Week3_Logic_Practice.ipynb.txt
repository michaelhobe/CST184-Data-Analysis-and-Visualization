# Scenario:
# You are assessing whether a country qualifies for Policy A.
# Policy A is designed to reward countries with high renewable energy use
# and low COâ‚‚ emissions per capita.

# Country data (you can modify these values below)
country_name = "Nepal"
percent_renewable = 60
co2_emissions = 1.8
region = "Asia"

# Define logical conditions
is_high_renewable = percent_renewable > 50
is_low_emission = co2_emissions < 2

# Combined logical proposition using AND
if is_high_renewable and is_low_emission:
    print(f"{country_name} qualifies for Policy A")
else:
    print(f"{country_name} does not qualify for Policy A")

# Display Boolean values for learning
print("High Renewable:", is_high_renewable)
print("Low Emission:", is_low_emission)
